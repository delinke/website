I am (Delinke Dedu) a London-based creative, graphic designer and illustrator. I picked up the crayons when I was still in nappies and I been doodling ever since. Drawing was the response for boredom and solitude in my childhood. I started to entertain myself with my creations. 
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile I finished Art University and trough individual experimentation I started to develop my own style. Sweets and different food elements have a strong inspiration effect on my works. 
Vector is the tool which gives form to my notions, my way to express myself. I simply love to create digital graphic with. (It is love of my life.)
As long as bread I make art, because I take some pleasure in what I do, I enjoy the results and I am more than happy if there is anyone to share with and entertain.
